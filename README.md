# Play Module
This is a python module with games in it. Now, these games aren't meant for humans to play; 
rather, all of the games are represented by a data structure, and can be interacted with through their methods.
This module is intended to interface with machine learning algorithms to train them on a multitude of games. 
The games I want to add here are ones that haven't been done as much(e.g. Wordle as opposed to Chess).
Note that the games don't have reward systems or other algorithms to play against; 
I leave such things to be decided upon by the user.

## Current Games
- Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## Games to be Added
- Wordle
- Solitaire
- Monopoly
